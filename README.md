### Ethics Reflection
Sensitive information, such as customer names or payment details, should never be logged because it risks privacy. Similarly, API keys or passwords must not be logged to avoid security breaches. Reproducibility ensures accountability and fairness, allowing results to be verified and trusted when models influence decisions affecting people.
